## Methodology

This project was developed using the **Agile methodology**, allowing for:
- Iterative development and testing
- Continuous feedback from stakeholders
- Flexibility in feature prioritization

Project planning was managed using a Gantt chart and a development logbook. Risks were identified and mitigated through consultation with a client.
